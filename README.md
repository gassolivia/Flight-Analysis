This code takes a list of flights for analysis, converting a PDF document to a text file.
A separate code parses through the text document to extract and analyze data. 
Currently it creates and exports two bar chart images with stop locations (stop or layover) and frequency. 
It further plots those points onto an interactive HTML map showing relative frequency.
It can be viewed on a github page here https://gassolivia.github.io/Flight-Analysis/
