This code takes the bid package PDF from PBS NavBlue and converts it into a text document using pdfplumber.
A separate code parses through the text document to extract and analyze data. 
Currently it creates and exports two bar chart images with stop locations (stop or layover) and frequency. 
It further plots those points onto an interactive HTML map showing relative frequency.
